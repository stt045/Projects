    "The gender wage gap has long been an issue in the United States. Recent research suggests that the wage gap has narrowed between men and women since the 1980s, but has changed little within the last 10 years.. While the number of women in the tech industry is rising, females are still largely considered to be part of the minority, and continue to make up less than 20% of the total number of employees at tech companies. Given this information, we are curious as to whether or not a wage gap exists in the tech industry, and if so, how large that wage gap is. \n",

    "This topic is of interest to our group because we all have an interest in technology, and many of us plan to work or be involved in the tech industry in some way in the future. Furthermore, technology continues to become more and more important in our daily lives and affects society and the way we live. As such, we believe that more women should be encouraged to pursue tech careers to promote innovation and, in doing so, be paid equally to men.\n",

    "### Gender vs. \"Income\"\n",
    "\"Income\" consists of 3 quantitative variables: Annualized Salary, Signing Bonus, Other Bonuses. The reason we want to look at these 3 quantitative variables is to get a more holistic representation of the amount of money an individual is bringing home, because salary may not be the most accurate representation because a person make only make a $40,000 but have another $40,000 in bonuses/ other compensation."
